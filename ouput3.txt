Hi,

When dealing with larger datasets, such as your 60,874 news articles, there are several common issues and considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Memory Limitations**: Ensure that your system has enough memory to handle the dataset. Large datasets can consume significant amounts of RAM, leading to failures if the system runs out of available memory.

2. **Batch Processing**: Instead of processing the entire dataset at once, consider breaking it down into smaller batches. This can help manage memory usage and make the process more manageable.

3. **Data Formatting**: Verify that the dataset is correctly formatted. Inconsistent or incorrect formatting can lead to processing errors. Ensure that each article follows a uniform structure.

4. **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data to remove any unnecessary information or noise. This can include steps like removing duplicates, handling missing values, and normalizing text.

5. **Tool Limitations**: Check the documentation of the `analyze_trends` tool for any limitations or recommended practices when dealing with large datasets. There may be specific configurations or parameters that need to be adjusted.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Look into ways to optimize the performance of your data analysis process. This could involve optimizing your code, using more efficient algorithms, or leveraging parallel processing techniques.

If you continue to face issues, it might be helpful to provide specific error messages or logs that occur when processing the larger dataset. This can give more insights into what might be going wrong and help identify a solution.

Best of luck with your analysis!

Best,
[Your Name]

I encountered an error while trying to use the tool. This was the error: 1 validation error for Ask question to coworkerSchema

  field required (type=value_error.missing).
 Tool Ask question to coworker accepts these inputs: Ask a specific question to one of the following coworkers: [Trend Analyzer]
The input to this tool should be the coworker, the question you have for them, and ALL necessary context to ask the question properly, they know nothing about the question, so share absolute everything you know, don't reference things but instead explain them.
